# My Emacs Folder


This is my custom emacs stack. I like to organize my emacs file with a
clear   separation  of   the   stock  emacs   configuration  and   the
configuration  related to  specific modes.   I find  that this  is the
easiest way  to overlap the  functionality of different modes  and get
the desired  results. I don't  mess with the .emacs.d  folder anymore,
I keep everything in a separate folder  `emacs`.

## Requirements
* Emacs 25 or greater.

## Installation

For installation just clone this repository to a specific directory; I
use `~/emacs` in Linux and  `C:/username/emacs` in windows.  I like to
keep my  emacs folder separate from  the .emacs.d folder so  I usually
create a symlink to  the .emacs file and put it in  my home folder. In
Windows I  usually create a shortcut  with "emacs -q -l"  and point to
the .emacs file.
