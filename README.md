# My Emacs Folder


This is my custom emacs stack. I like to organize my emacs file with a
clear   separation  of   the   stock  emacs   configuration  and   the
configuration  related to  specific modes.   I find  that this  is the
easiest way  to overlap the  functionality of different modes  and get
the desired  results. I don't  mess with the .emacs.d  folder anymore,
I keep everything in a separate folder named `emacs`.

This configuration is intended to be used with emacs as a daemon.

NOTE:  I use  a  non English  keyboard  layout  - Ã‘  is  used in  some
keybindings.

## Requirements
* Emacs 25 or greater.

## Installation

To install, clone this repository to a specific directory -  I use  `~/emacs` in Linux or  `C:/<username>/emacs` for a Windows installation.
I usually symlink the .emacs file to my home folder in Linux or Users/`<username>`/AppData/Roaming/  in Windows.
