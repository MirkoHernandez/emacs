# My Emacs Folder

This is my custom emacs stack. I like to organize my emacs file with a
clear   separation  of   the   stock  emacs   configuration  and   the
configuration  related to  specific modes.   I find  that this  is the
easiest way  to overlap the  functionality of different modes  and get
the desired results.

This configurations is intended to be used with emacs as a daemon.

NOTE: I use a non English keyboard layout, Ã‘ is used in some
keybindings.

## Requirements
* Emacs 25 or greater.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/emacs` in Linux or   `C:/<username>/emacs` for a Windows installation.
I usually symlink the .emacs file to my home folder in Linux or Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/  in Windows.
